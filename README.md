What it does:
Dollars & Sense will help these young adults learn about personal finances by setting goals and gathering points when they complete specific tasks. Similar to how connecting Progressive auto insurance users to the Snapshot app can make them eligible for insurance deductions, selected banks who choose to partner with Dollars & Sense will give young adults (ages 16-24) the opportunity to have their APY percentages increased OR their credit card interest rates decreased. This would all depend on how active and complete their learning goals are.  

How we built it:
Used Replit, Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, Figma, Canva

Challenges we ran into:
Figuring out how to keep all the individual pages centered and not smushed together when viewed on a desktop or mobile device. Deciding on what applications to use for our project and making a mobile app or website. Learning more about what HTML can do and figuring out how to use CSS properly. Had to drastically scope down from making a mobile application to a web app because of our skill level and time constraints.

What's next for Dollar & Sense:
To expand the web app as a mobile iOS/Android app and include an even more user experience with features such as:
Scanning receipts to track budget and earn even more points
Fun short videos to enhance the learning experience
Have a purchase analysis
Additional financial literacy courses on retirement, family planning, stocks, crypto, home-buying vs. renting 
Partner with Miami high schools & 
Collab with banks for special offers/perks
